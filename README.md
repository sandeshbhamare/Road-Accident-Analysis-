# Road-Accident-Analysis-
In my Road Accident Analysis project using Excel, I delved into accident data, examining various factors like weather conditions, road surfaces, locations, vehicle types, and casualties. Through meticulous data extraction, cleaning, and analysis, I constructed an intuitive dashboard for visual representation. This dashboard, inclusive of key performance indicators (KPIs), not only facilitated easy comprehension but also provided valuable insights crucial for accident prevention strategies and enhancing overall road safety measures.
I have learned the following:

   1) Pivot table
   2) Power Query
   3) DAX
   4) Conditional Formatting
   5) Report Beautification
   6) Generating KPI`s
